            After traveling extensively throughout the United States, Neville
            eventually made his home in Los Angeles where, in the 1950s, he gave
            a series of talks on television and radio, and for many years
            lectured regularly to capacity audiences at the Wilshire Ebell
            Theater. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he confined most of his
            lectures to Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his early lectures and books Neville dealt solely with what he
            called The Law, the technique of creating one’s physical reality
            through imagining. It is this portion of his expression that most
            closely accords with the teachings of the New Thought movement. In
            describing The Law, Neville related how he made a sea voyage from
            New York to see his family in Barbados during theDepression, without
            any money of his own.
          </p>
          <p>
            He related how, by the use of imaginal power, he was honorably
            discharged from military service to continue his lectures during
            World War II. He gave his audiences in San Francisco in the 1950s
            and 1960s accounts of how others had made use of The Law. He
            discussed it on television in the Los Angeles area, saying, “Learn
            how to use your imaginal power, lovingly, on behalf of others, for
            Man is moving into a world where everything is subject to his
            imaginal power.”
